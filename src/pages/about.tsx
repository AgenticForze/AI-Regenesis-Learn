          <h2>The chapter contract</h2>
          <p>
            To keep quality consistent as dozens of contributors add chapters over time, every
            concept-level chapter follows the same seven-section template — TL;DR, High-Level
            Explanation, Deep-Dive Explanation, Comparison &amp; Related Concepts, Reference
            Architecture, Industry Use Cases, and Check Your Understanding. A chapter isn't done
            until all seven are filled in. Two phases (9 and 14) intentionally use a lighter
            four-section landscape template instead — see{' '}
            <a href="/docs/orientation/0-6-content-standard-explained">
              0.6 The Content Standard, Explained
            </a>{' '}
            for the full breakdown of why.

          <h2>How the site stays honest as it grows</h2>
          <p>
            This is a continuously growing knowledge base, not a fixed course — new chapters start
            from a GitHub issue, get written against the shared template, and go live the moment
            they merge. There's no "big launch" being held back. Periodic judge-LLM review passes
            (the process behind v3, v4, and v5 of the curriculum) are run quarterly to catch new
            production patterns before they become content gaps — see the{' '}
            <a href="/changelog">Changelog</a> for what each pass found and fixed, and the{' '}
            <a href="/roadmap">Roadmap</a> for what ships next.
